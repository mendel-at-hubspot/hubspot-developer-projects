## Base structure

The end result of each project with the base structure should be the following:

  - One private app named `My private app` which opens up the scopes group `crm.objects.contacts.read`
  - One CRM Extension card which can be enabled in the middle pane for contacts
  - One serverless app function which can be invoked from the extension card using the name `myFunc`
  - One CMS javascript module called `TodoList` which can be embedded in a website page
  - One CMS javascript partial called `Home` which can be embedded in HubL for a theme
